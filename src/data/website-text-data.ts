    content: `Dimitri Hector doesn't belong to just one world. Trained in Graham, Horton, 
        classical ballet, and the wildly social art of West Coast 
        Swing, Dimitri moves between concert stages and ballroom 
        floors with a fluidity that takes years to earn. 
        Whether he's in repertoire with the New York Dance Project, 
        competing on the international swing floor or working on freelance projects, he brings the same 
        thing every time: a body that listens, a willing mind, 
        and a presence that fills the 
        room before the music even starts.`,

    content: `Dimitri's path has never been a straight line, and 
        the art is richer for it. Cutting his teeth as a teaching 
        assistant at Cornell University before building a freelance 
        career across New York City's most respected stages and studios, 
        he's developed a rare dual fluency. Equally at home in improvisational dance technique and the choreographic realm- 
        he's performed alongside Alvin Ailey Extension dancers, 
        taken the stage with Earl Mosley's Diversity of Dance, 
        and brought authentic jazz-era Lindy Hop to life for Gatsby 
        Entertainment. Each experience has added a new layer, a new dimension, 
        a new tool in a growing vocabulary that refuses to be defined by a single genre.`,

    content: `Offstage, Dimitri is just as dedicated to the culture as he is to the craft. 
        As an internationally competitive West Coast Swing dancer — All-Star level, 
        Hall of Fame nominee, and a regular fixture on the top-5 podium at major events — 
        he's also spent years teaching the dance to students of every level and 
        background. He genuinely believes that movement is something everyone 
        deserves access to. But make no mistake: this is a performer first. Look him up. 
        Watch him move. Then tell him where you need him.`,
